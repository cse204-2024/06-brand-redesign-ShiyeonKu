                <p>Haane Manahi (1913–1986) was a New Zealand Māori soldier who served in the Second World War with the Māori Battalion. He joined the battalion in 1939 and fought in the German invasion of Greece, the Battle of Crete and the North African campaign. In April 1943, during the Tunisian campaign, his gallantry in an action at Takrouna resulted in a recommendation, supported by four generals, that he be awarded the Victoria Cross. This was downgraded to an award of the Distinguished Conduct Medal, which disappointed many of his fellow soldiers. After his death in a car crash in 1986, representations were made for a posthumous award of the Victoria Cross for his valour at Takrouna. These representations were unsuccessful but eventually resulted in a special award in 2007 of an altar cloth for use in a local church, a ceremonial sword, and a personal letter from Queen Elizabeth II in recognition of his gallantry. This June 1943 photograph of Manahi was taken in Maadi, Egypt, by George Robert Bull, the official photographer of the New Zealand armed forces.</p>
